# Wii Network Config Viewer
Check your Wii's Network Profiles details!

# How to use :

This app can edit each profile (something that Wii Network Config Editor can't do, lol), let's see how every part works :

When starting the app you should get this message :

Just press PLUS to proceed, after that you'll see info about the size of the config file.

Now you should see something like this :

You can press LEFT or RIGHT on the D-Pad to switch between profiles, if you desire to edit one of them just go to the profile and press 2.

Here's a look at the edit menu :

In this menu there is two types of actions; toggling and going to a submenu.

You can toggle the options by pressing A, or if you want to go to any of the submenus (Proxy, DNS, IP and wireless) just make sure the cursor has a "+" on it, like shown below :

<img width="195" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1543d167-5ef2-4a89-9124-26f3c4c1ebdf" />

Let's start with the Proxy submenu.

Here's how it looks when blank :

<img width="640" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fbd6712-b844-4733-b184-580025295b5f" />

When editing a string type setting you'll see a keyboard appear on the screen :

<img width="609" height="483" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6428743b-aa41-4a95-9eb3-46a5fdc5fa35" />

You just aim at it and press A when the desired character is highlighted.

When editing a Number type setting (like the Port for instance), the shift will be locked, and you can't write characters, only numbers.

When done writing, just press HOME to save and go back, the same key is used to go back to the edit menu.

Note : You can't leave the fields blank if Proxy is enabled.

Moving to the DNS submenu (the IP submenu is the same, so I'm not explaining again how to use it), it should look like this when blank : 

<img width="636" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58b435b-a111-43ff-b403-18a759525af6" />

Select whatever you want to edit and press A, the keyboard will appear on the screen, and like the Proxy port you can't write letters.

Note : DNS (or IP/Router IP/Submask) can't exceed 255.255.255.255.

And lastly the WiFi submenu :

<img width="587" height="437" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a5ccfff-483b-432e-a888-d89b56818cfe" />

The only different thing here is the security type, and here's what you should know :

- When changing between security types the password gets deleted, if you want to cancel the changes just go back to the main menu without saving.
- WPA/WPA2 requires passwords that are at least 8 characters, WEP64 requires 5 and WEP128 requires 13.

When done changing settings, go back to the edit menu and press PLUS to save.


If you encounter any issue, please create an issue post on the repository.
